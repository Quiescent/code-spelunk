** DONE [1] Navigating earlier than the root goes into a bad state
   CLOSED: [2020-02-08 Sat 14:15]
   :LOGBOOK:
   - CLOSING NOTE [2020-02-08 Sat 14:15] \\
     Implemented in tandem with FEATURE 2 which added a parent slot to tree
     nodes.  This made the fix trivial.
   :END:
Description: going back in the tree beyond the root node results in a
state where all subsequent attempts to modify the tree fail.

Recipe:
 - Open a buffer.
 - Activate tracking.
 - Navigate to a definition with ~xref-find-definitions~.
 - Run ~xref-pop-marker-stack~ twice.
 - Run ~xref-find-definitions~.

Observed behaviour:
 - Error is produced: =slot-value: Wrong type argument: (or eieio-object class), nil, obj=

Expected behaviour:
 - It should simply start recording from the root again.
 - It should *not* produce any errors.

** TODO [2] Adding to tree when xref doesn't find destination
Description: when ~xref-find-definitions~ doesn't find a location for
the definition ~spelunk~ is still adding an entry to the tree as
though we jumped.

Recipe:
 - Open a buffer.
 - Activate tracking.
 - Navigate to a definition which doesn't exist with
   ~xref-find-definitions~.

Observed behaviour:
 - ~xref~ produces an error that there are no suitable definitions.
 - ~spelunk~ adds a history node to the tree.

Expected behaviour:
 - ~xref~ produces an error that there are no suitable definitions.
 - ~spelunk~ does *not* add a history node to the tree.

* Features

** TODO [1] Print the edges in the tree
The tree is currently printed with nodes simply stacked on top of each
other.  It would be nice to draw the edges between parents and
children.

** DONE [2] Keep parent nodes in child nodes to make going back trivial and accurate

   :LOGBOOK:

     Adding the parent node made going back trivial.
   :END:
Right now I "go back" in the tree by traversing it from the root and
finding the parent of the node who's child is has the name of the
current node.  This is not general, e.g. there could be many tags with
the same name in a code base!  If I simply stored the parent of a node
then this problem disappears.

** TODO [3] Implement two modes for useful implementation
It doesn't make sense to keep the tree around for an entire
programming session.  If you did so then the tree would become a
conglomeration of odd pieces of the code base where you did and didn't
use ~xref-find-definitions~ to move around.

It would be more useful to either explicitly start sessions, or to
have the system automatically start sessions and trash older trees
after some reasonable interval of time has expired.

*** DONE [4] Mode 1: Transient tree
    CLOSED: [2020-02-15 Sat 12:57]
    :LOGBOOK:
    - CLOSING NOTE [2020-02-15 Sat 12:57]
    :END:
~code-spelunk-transient-tracking-mode~ should be a global mode with the following rules:
 - A tree should be created for your current session when one doesn't
   exist.
 - When a tree does exist then track it using the usual rules.
 - When a tree exists, but it's existed for more than
   ~code-spelunk-transient-session-length~ seconds then delete the
   tree and start from scratch.
 - Modes ~code-spelunk-transient-tracking-mode~ and
   ~code-spelunk-explicit-session-mode~ are mutually exclusive.

*** TODO [5] Mode 2: Explicit Spelunking sessions
~code-spelunk-explicit-session-mode~ should be a global mode with the
following rules:
 - A user starts tracking a session by running the command
   ~code-spelunk-start-session~.
 - A user ends a tracking session by running the command
   ~code-spelunk-end-session~.
 - When a session ends then all trees are cleared.
 - When a session begins then all trees are cleared.
 - Modes ~code-spelunk-transient-tracking-mode~ and
   ~code-spelunk-explicit-session-mode~ are mutually exclusive.

** TODO [6] Render the tree with Graphviz
I recently encountered a package which visualises hierarchies from org
buffers using Graphviz.  It gave me the idea to try that very thing
for printing the tree.

** DONE [7] Add key bindings while the visualisation is active for moving in it
   CLOSED: [2020-02-09 Sun 13:07]
   :LOGBOOK:
   - CLOSING NOTE [2020-02-09 Sun 13:07]
   :END:
~xref-pop-marker-stack~ and ~xref-goto-definition~ in combination
don't have the same effect as navigating a tree of tags.  If you use
~xref-pop-marker-stack~ then it wont necessarily go up in the tree
because ~xref~ uses a *marker ring*.

This feature proposes the addition of key bindings to go up, down,
left and right in the tree.

** DONE [8] Turn the entries in the history window into links
   CLOSED: [2020-02-09 Sun 11:52]
   :LOGBOOK:
   - CLOSING NOTE [2020-02-09 Sun 11:52]
   :END:
It would be nice if you could hit enter or click on the entries in the
tree visualisation window and navigate straight to the definition.
